Please get in touch with the organizers in case of any questions.

## Scope and Topics

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to,
- Cooperative and comprehensible motion planning
- Probabilistic decision making and motion planning (including MDPs, POMDPs, MMDPs)
- Probabilistic behavior prediction (with help of semantic high definition maps)
- Evaluation and benchmarking for probabilistic prediction
- Evaluation and benchmarking for comprehensible motion planning
